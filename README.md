#Fargo Outline Search
Allows you to search the text nodes within your outliner for specific phrases. It is case sensitive and looks for an exact match at the moment. 

**NOTE** At the moment, this only supports search via the Console. It is in active dev to add a visual display for search terms.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Copy the contents of style.css and paste it in to your Settings -> CSS pane
3. Copy the contents of search.js and paste it in to your Settings -> Code pane
