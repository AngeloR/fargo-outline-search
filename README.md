#Fargo Outline Search
Allows you to search the text nodes within your outliner for specific phrases. It is case sensitive and looks for an exact match at the moment. 


## Preferred Installation
Link directly to the Search script on GitHub for the most up to date version. 
`$('body').append('<script src="https://raw.github.com/AngeloR/fargo-outline-search/master/search.js"></script>');`

## Alternate Installation
If you're not comfortable running the above script, you can clone the repository and manually copy and paste the contents of "search.js" into the Settings->Code panel.
